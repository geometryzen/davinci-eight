/**
 * The VertexPrimitive class provides the preferred method for creating geometries.
 * Classes derived from VertexPrimitive create vertices and pathways through them
 * with indices such as TRIANGLE_STRIP. (Reversing this procedure from an arbitrary
 * collection of simplices is an NP problem). The resulting topology can then be
 * modified by a parameterized function either prior to buffering or in a shader.
 * VertexPrimitive uses the Vertex structure which is based on VectorN for ease of mesh
 * generation and transformation. Topolgy provides a toPrimitive method which results
 * in a more compact representation based upon number[]. An even more compact
 * representation is VertexArrays, which interleaves the vertex.
